## üìñ About  

**LedeMekai** is a web-based multiple disease prediction system designed to help users identify potential health conditions based on their symptoms.  
It addresses the healthcare access gap in developing regions by offering preliminary, accessible diagnostic support for critical diseases such as ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancer.  

The system uses a trained **Random Forest** machine learning model to provide the top three most probable diseases with confidence scores, records predictions in the user‚Äôs profile, and recommends nearby hospitals based on predicted conditions and the user‚Äôs location.  

## ‚ú® Key Features  

- **Symptom-Based Predictions:** Users enter demographic data and select symptoms via a responsive interface.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained Random Forest classifier outputs top three probable diseases with confidence scores.  
- **User Profiles:** Stores previous predictions for easy access and tracking.  
- **Hospital Recommendations:** Suggests nearby hospitals based on predicted conditions and user location.  
- **Scrum Methodology:** Developed iteratively using requirement analysis, database modeling, and testing cycles.  
- **Responsive Design:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend optimized for desktops and mobile devices.  
- **External API Integration:** Location-based hospital search integrated with the system.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack  

### Backend  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest (scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **External APIs:** Location-based hospital recommendations  

### Frontend  
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** for responsive, user-centered design  

### Development & Tools  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üìã System Workflow

User Registration/Login: Users create profiles to save prediction history.

Symptom Entry: Demographic and symptom data entered via the web interface.

Prediction Engine: Random Forest model processes inputs and outputs top three disease probabilities with confidence scores.

Hospital Recommendation: System suggests nearby hospitals using location APIs.

Result Storage: Predictions saved to the user‚Äôs profile for future reference.

## üîê Security Features

Secure password hashing and session management.

Input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and SQL injection.

Environment variables for sensitive keys.

## üìä Evaluation

The system was tested extensively with unit and integration testing, demonstrating strong model accuracy and interface usability.

## üë• Default User Roles

User: Enter symptoms, view predictions, access hospital recommendations.

Admin (optional): Manage datasets, monitor model performance, and oversee system usage.
